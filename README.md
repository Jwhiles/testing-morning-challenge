# testing-morning-challenge

Your morning challenge is to make the tests pass, and then to write a couple tests.  Test framework being used is [Q-Unit](http://api.qunitjs.com/).

The assertions that are being used in the test can be found here: http://api.qunitjs.com/category/assert/

Instructions:

1. Clone this repo

2. Take a quick look at test.html, notice the script tags

3. Open the test.html file in the browser, you should see the first test fail

4. Now open test.js - this file holds some tests and some functions

5. Locate the firstTest function and the first test

6. Change the firstTest function to make the corresponding test pass.

7. Save and refresh the browser to see it pass

8. Complete for the rest of the tests

9. Write tests for the last two functions
